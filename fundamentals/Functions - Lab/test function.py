# correct is d my answer d

#9. What is the difference between a function definition and a function call?
#: A function definition defines the behavior of a function, while a function call executes that behavior.
#B: A function definition executes the behavior of a function, while a function call defines that behavior.
#C: There is no difference; both terms refer to the same action.
#D: A function definition defines input parameters, while a function call provides actual arguments.
